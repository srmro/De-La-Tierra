http://localhost:3570/user
http://localhost:3570/annuals

http://localhost:3570/crops

Establish a connection to the MongoDB database to be able to use CRUD and see changes.


##Frontend

-Created a Login/Signup form
-An About page
-A Navigation Bar to be able to direct user to pages
-If you click on the icon onto the left you'll also be re-directed to the welcome page
-A page, Starting on a Garden, to help you get started on that garden!

-On Starting a Garden, there would be links on the Annuals, Perennials, and Crops. Click on them and you'll be re-directed to information based on the link you selected.

-Choose a subtle theme, and fonts for the page.

-Newsfeed page underconstruction
